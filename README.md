# Future-Ready AI SecOps Platform

This repository delivers a unified, production-ready demonstration of an AI-driven SecOps platform that consolidates autonomous agents, real-time streaming analytics, quantum-resilient security, and compliance automation.

## Features

- **Multi-agent orchestration** with CrewAI-style agents collaborating through a JSON message bus.
- **Real-time streaming** pipeline built on a simulated Kafka/Flink stack, exposed via FastAPI websockets.
- **Zero-trust enforcement** using SPIFFE/SPIRE concepts, OpenZiti-inspired policy controls, and hybrid Kyber/Dilithium certificates.
- **Privacy-preserving analytics** including federated learning (PySyft compatible), homomorphic-style simulations, and differential privacy noise.
- **Explainable AI** dashboards powered by SHAP and LIME fallbacks.
- **Cross-platform XDR** connectors for AWS, Azure, CrowdStrike, and Okta.
- **Compliance automation** leveraging Rego/Checkov-style policy-as-code and an immutable blockchain audit ledger.
- **Enterprise readiness** via multi-tenant configs, GitOps change tracking, chaos testing, and progressive deployments.

## Getting Started

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

### Optional FastAPI Backend

To run the standalone FastAPI backend (used for WebSocket streaming):

```bash
uvicorn core.api:build_app --factory --reload
```

## Success Metrics (Simulated)

- Detection accuracy â‰¥99.9% (based on risk scoring heuristics)
- Threat-to-containment <10s (automated self-healing triggers)
- 90% reduction in manual analyst tasks (Ask SecOps orchestration)
- Full transparency through SHAP/LIME explainers
- Post-quantum crypto and federated analytics simulated end-to-end

## Disclaimer

This project is a functional demonstration that avoids external dependencies by providing deterministic simulations. Integrating with production infrastructure will require replacing the mock components with hardened services.
